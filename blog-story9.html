                    <p>Mindy and I met up after my classes to try out an internet cafe for the first time. We walked to one nearby in Akihabara where they asked us to set up a membership. We showed them our resident cards and we became members. They gave us a booth with a computer for about two hours and they had unlimited drinks and a lot of manga that we could pick from and read. Overall it was actually pretty fun and only about 900 yen per person.</p>

I felt really terrible and planned on just asking my professor for class notes before going home but she cancelled class anyways so I went home and slept.</p>

                    <p>I visited the Ghibli Museum in Mitaka which was super fun with primarily interactive exhibits. Cogs you can turn, film reels to play, spiral staircases and holes in the walls, and even a cardboard maze with really fun obstacles. Unfortunately within the museum, no photos or videos were allowed so I couldn't record much. I bought 4 post cards with art from Porco Rosso, Princess Mononoke, and My Neighbor Totoro as well as a small pin featuring characters from my neighbor totoro. I will definitely bring Alex to there if we have time because it was such a cool place. The tickets aren’t expensive, just difficult to get. Afterwards I ate at Ichiron Ramen in Shinjuku with some friends and finally came home to pass out.</p>

                    <p>Mindy and I went to get some gyoza for breakfast near Meidaimae station around noon. We wanted to relax a bit in the morning before we went out. Around 4 PM we went to Shinjuku to begin our trek towards Kawagoe for a festival. I was still feeling pretty sick but I decided to go anyways because it sounded fun. We ended up getting stuck on one of the trains because someone had an accident at one of the stations.</p>

                    <p>We finally got to Kawagoe and wandered around trying to find the festival. Around 8ish we found it and ate so much food. There were chocolate covered bananas, okonomiyaki (pancakes with veggies and meat), mangos with juice in them, baked potatoes with butter, and grilled squids on sticks. There was a lot of other food but that was just what we got.</p>

                    <p>There was also a giant religious float that was being pulled by drunk people in traditional wear and that was interesting to see. Overall it was really fun and I would recommend it.</p>
