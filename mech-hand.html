                        <strong>The First Iterations</strong>

                    <p>The first iteration (depicted here) was limited to 1/8" plywood, 1/8" delrin, 0.05” 5052 aluminum sheet metal, and common hardware. The concept was to have cable driven fingers on adjustable pivots to pick up strangely shaped objects during the final challenge. Linear springs were placed between the finger segments to keep the hand open when resting. The transmission relied on a delrin spool that collects the metal cables in the "palm" of the hand.</p>

                    <p>This first iteration had quite a few failures. The DC motor provided did not have enough power to generate a large enough moment to bend the fingers. This could have been adjusted by a combination of rewiring the cables in the finders such that the eye-holes guiding the cables, using weaker springs, and finding a stronger motor. The spool transmission implemented in this iteration was also too sloppy as there was consistantly too much slack in the cables for the hand to efficiently grasp objects.</p>

                    <p>The second iteration was completely 3D printed on Makerbot Replicator 2's and used hardware and poured rubber polymer for assembly. To take advantage of the stange shapes that can be made on the Makerbots, we tried an alernative finger design that had a slot to act as a mold for the rubber polymer to be poured into. Once the polymer set, the PLA of the mold could be cracked off leaving only the finger. The transmission for this iteration used a 3D printed lead screw and bevel gears. The cables were crimped to the tips of the claws and guieded through the claws and into the palm where they were crimped to the nut on the lead screw so as the motor brought the nut down, the hand closed.</p>

                    <p>The main failure of this iteration was the weakness of the rubber polymer used and the round tips of the printed digits. Stiffer polymers were explored and sharper ends were added to the claw tips to assist in picking up items.</p>

                    <p>For the final iteration, we were allowed 100 grams of 3D-printed PLA, 18”x18” total surface area of planar material (1/8" plywood, 1/8" Delrin, 0.05” 5052 aluminum sheet metal), and $25 worth of parts from McMaster-Carr.</p>

                     <p>The final claw has a plywood and 3D printed 3 claw structure with flexibility provided by a rubber polymer. The transmission relied on three cables crimped from each claw end to a steel lead screw powered by DC motor. For this iteration's transmission I CAD modeled and 3D printed both bevel gears used and turned down the lead screw to fit within the structure. Nearly all the parts were then spray painted for a black and red theme to match the given DC motor wiring. We were able to pick up spheres of different diameters from stress balls to a softball, a water bottle, a bar of soap, and a CD.</p>

                     <p>This iteration took the best traits of the first two: the stiffer polymer to provide an open equilibrium position, angled claws to provide a larger grasp, claw tips to assist picking up objects, rubber polymer lining on the insides of the finger segments for better grip, and a taut cable, lead screw transmission to eliminate slack. However, the orientation of the ball bearing housing the end of the lead screw opposite the gears became our failure. When attempting to lift a dumbbell, the iterference grip holding the ball bearing into the palm slipped and the leadscrew fell loose. Had we had the opportunity to redo the challenge, we would have inverted the bearing so that the weight able to be lifted was not entirely dependent on the friction between plywood and steel parts.</p>
