                <h3>Gold Colloids</h3>
                <p>Colloidal gold is a fluid suspension of gold nanoparticles, between about 10 nanometers and 2 micrometers in size. This project explores the effect of varied synthesis methods. The main variations are of the volume of sodium citrate and TEOS precursor used. We find that by varying these concentrations in synthesis of gold colloid and silica coated gold colloid, we can modify the size and configuration of the nanoparticles and in turn the frequency of surface plasmon resonance, thus changing optical properties of the material. The nanoparticle size and configuration were examined using a transmission electron microscope. These changes were then captured on a macroscopic scale by observing color change through photospectroscopy. Nanoparticle design is a relatively new field with applications in drug delivery, sensor platforms, and semiconductor development</p>

        <h3>Gold Colloid Synthesis</h3>
                <p>We followed the classic Turkevich gold colloid synthesis method using 1.50 mL sodium citrate solution at 1% by weight sodium citrate. Having successfully created a gold colloid sample, we then created four different samples of gold colloid, A, B, C and D, with 0.75 mL, 1.50 mL, 3.0 mL and 6.0 mL sodium citrate solution precursor respectively. All other synthesis processes and volumes were uniform between the four samples.</p>

        <h3>Gold Colloid Results</h3>
                <p>In the Turkevich production method, sodium citrate acts as a stabilizing agent during nanoparticle aggregation. We successfully varied the amount of citrate in order to influence resulting stable particle size. The resulting samples showed absorbance peaks between 510 and 530 nanometers. The absorbance peaks can be seen using photospectroscopy as shown in the figure below. The color variance is clear enough to be observed by the naked eye.</p>

                <img src="img/goldnano/sodiumcit.png" width="80%">
                </center>

                <p>The colloid with the lowest amount of citrate, sample A, has a peak at the highest wavelength. This is expected, as we expect sample A to contain the largest particles. Sample B’s peak is roughly 538 nm. Sample C and D have peaks at roughly the same wavelength, 517 nm, Sample D, with the most silicate, likely is less absorbent at all frequencies because with this amount of citrate particle size was distributed more widely.</p>

                <p>Under a transmission electron microscope, we find that the characteristic shape of the gold nanoparticles are not spheres, as many mathematical analysis of colloids assume, but an oblong potato shape. Sample B had notably more aggregation with gold nanoparticles clinging together via van der Waals forces.</p>

                </center>
                <br>
                <p>Our sample A gold colloid nanoparticles, synthesized with 0.75 mL sodium citrate solution, averaged about 53 nm in length and 34 nm in width while sample B, synthesized with 1.5 mL sodium citrate solution, averaged about 28 nm in length and 27 nm in width. We suspect that increasing sodium citrate solution precursor decreases the size of the gold nanoparticles, and that it is easier to maintain a spherical shape at smaller sizes.</p>

        <h3>Colloid Aggregation</h3>
                <p>A stable gold colloid would have sodium citrate ions attaching and detaching from the surface of the gold nanoparticles at the same rate. However, stability is inversely proportional to particle concentration thus the more densely packed the particles, the more likely they are to come into contact what the sodium citrate ions release from a surface bonding site. Ripening in colloids is the phenomena in which smaller particles flux towards larger ones. Boltzmann's law implies that there will be a concentration gradient of a colloid object in medium. Stoke's law contribute the velocity at which the particles approach the gradient</p>
        <h3>SiO2@Au Synthesis</h3>
                <p>Gold colloid sample C was then used in a silica coated gold colloid synthesis following the Mine method in order to investigate the effect of tertaethoxysilane (TEOS) solution precursor. Four samples of SiO2@Au colloid A, B, C, and D, were created using 25 μL , 50 μL, 150 μL, and 250 μL TEOS solution respectively.</p>

        <h3>SiO2@Au Results</h3>
                <p>The color shift caused by adding the silica shell to the gold nanoparticles was not apparent to the naked eye due to the diffusive nature of the colloid. Comparing a sample of gold colloid to the same gold colloid with a silica coating using a photospectrometer, we see that there is an absorbance peak increase of approximately 5 nm. Although there is a significant increase in particle diameter, other factors such as index of refraction, distance between particle and observer, and scattering scattering angle reduce the magnitude of the absorbance shift compared to varying sodium citrate concentrations as shown in the equation for Rayleigh approximation of Mei scattering.</p>

                <p>In the figure below we can effectively disregard the data from Samples A and B, whose synthesis was unsuccessful. During the cleaning phase, these particles irreversibly aggregated in the centrifuge. Sample C, who contained less silica than D, finds a “peak” at roughly 522 nm. This peak is more visible in Figure 5. This “peak” is not actually a maximum for Sample D, but instead marks the place at which the response drops off more quickly with wavelength. This is estimated to be at about 526 nm, suggesting that increasing the amount of silica will increase absorbance peak. This aligns with our expectations that Sample D should have a larger coating.</p>

                </center>

                <p>Observing the SiO2@Au particles under a transmission electron microscope, we find that the shape of the particles are far more homogeneous and spherical than the characteristically potato shaped gold nanoparticles. Both samples showed dark gold nuclei in lighter silica shells of varying diameter. Some silica shells had many gold nanoparticles encapsulated while others formed secondary silica particles without gold nuclei. In other areas, stray gold nanoparticles were viable without a silica shell. These irregularities could be caused by a lack of silica or gold in certain regions which caused the silica to nucleate without gold and the gold to aggregate together. Flocculation did occur as bridges connecting two or more silica shells were formed between particles.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Increasing the volume of TEOS solution in synthesis varied the increased of the silica shell as there were more silicon from the breakdown of TEOS available to coat the gold nanoparticles. Our silica coated gold colloid sample C (150 μL TEOS ) had an average silica shell diameter of 116 nm while sample D (250 μL TEOS ) had an average silica shell diameter of 141 nm.</p>

        <h3>Discussion and Future Work</h3>
                <p>As we have shown, varying the volume of sodium citrate solution and TEOS solution added during the gold colloid synthesis and silica coated gold colloid synthesis respectively, we find that there is a notable difference in nanoparticle size and shape and and resulting color. It is good to note that the colonies of particles in the TEM images could be caused by capillary action during the drying process of the colloid onto the lacy carbon grid. Other aggregations of the nanoparticle could have been caused by inadequate stirring and thermal agitation during the chemical reaction or extended sit periods between labs. Overall, the colloids made are stable on the order of weeks but when taking higher concentrations for photospectroscopy, visible aggregates formed over a few days. We attempted to setting colloids in a cold set epoxy resin however, the amount of colloid required for visible coloring tampered with the concentrations of the resin and greatly extended the set time. For future work, we would like to investigate setting our gold colloids as inert solids with rich color.</p>
