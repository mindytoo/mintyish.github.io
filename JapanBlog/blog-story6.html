                    <p>Monday morning was my first official day of classes. It was Silver week in Japan (three days of holiday) but we still had class on Monday for some reason. It was mostly empty so the professor just gave a short overview of the class before letting us out early.</p>

                    <p>I had two back to back orientation sessions today. -Cringes- One for CIEE again and the other for Sophia University. However, it was all worth it because I got the student commuter pass on my Suica card that would allow me to freely go between my dorm station, Fujimidai, and the university station, Yotsuya. It’s exciting not having to pay.</p>

                    <p>I had my Japanese Language placement test in the morning during which I realized I knew no Kanji outside of the very, very basic characters and those in Mahjong. However, I didn’t feel any pressure to cram or study since it was for placement and whatever I didn’t know, I would get the chance to learn later this semester. After I waited outside the testing rooms for some friends and we wandered around Shibuya for a bit.</p>

                    <p>Today I had one of the final orientation sessions from CIEE, after which I would be untethered to enjoy the rest of the semester in Tokyo mostly on my own. It was mostly the same “don’t do drugs” and call this number if you’re in trouble. After we headed to the Life Safety Learning Center in Ikebukuro where we experienced a size 7 earthquake simulation and put out faux fires.</p>

I finally took her to butadon and it seems like she really enjoyed it. [I really enjoyed it -Mindy] I went back to campus for class while Mindy just walked around the Nakano area to kill time. We ended up just hanging out at my place for a few hours before getting ramen for dinner with Kevin.</p>

                    <p>Today was CIEE’s planned trip to Kamakura, one of the past capitals of Japan. Currently it’s famous for a giant buddha statue that you can enter for 20 yen. Of course the day was rainy and of course we were rushed the entire day to follow a walking tour schedule. Still, the temples and shrines were super pretty and we had a lunch of karaage and tempura. There is also an amazing taiyaki stand just outside of the Kamakura station from which I got 10 small but delicious anko taiyaki.</p>

                    <p>Mindy and I went to Ueno to meet with some of her friends to take a look at the shopping district. We were all really hungry when we got there so we went to an okonomiyaki and monja restaurant where we had to cook our own food basically. I feel like we had a tough time but the food was really good. We ended up walking around Ueno for about 4 or 5 hours and then decided to just go home.</p>

                    <p>Today was the date for a trip that the Meiji students had been planning for the exchange students. We met up with them in Shinjuku and then they took us to Tsukiji, basically the fish district of Tokyo. There’s a couple blocks of just fish stores and restaurants and it’s considered the freshest fish in Tokyo. We were split off into groups and I walked around for a while with my group before getting a bowl of fish and rice for lunch. Legitimately the best fish I’ve ever had. We left Tsukiji to go to Ueno to go to the large zoo they have there. We walked around the zoo for about 4 hours and I got to see some animals I’ve never seen before, namely red pandas and giant pandas. Or group split up to go home just after the zoo closed at 5.</p>

                    <p>I woke up late to meet with team okonomiyaki. Initially planned to go to a moon festival but since all the weather reports said it was going to rain, we decided to go to two other places, a light art installation in Ginza and a matsuri in Aomonoyokocho. The art installation was really incredible, there was an entire room with LEDs that were synced up beautifully and walking through the loop with mirrors and strings of lights on both sides made you feel like you were falling through stars. We actually came too late to the matsuri but a friend of mine did get to show off his drinking skills to some local men running a beer stand. Afterwards we headed to Shinjuku to buy school supplies and go to karaoke. It was my first Japanese karaoke but it was really fun!</p>
