                    <p>Researching under Professor Alisha Sarang-Sieminski at Olin College, three other undergraduate students and I worked with the Santos Family Foundation to frame a SCOPE project for a team of seniors for the upcoming fall 2014 semester. We to translate the foundation's mission of improving automobile safety into a tangible project that would further undergraduate engineering education. The final deliverable is a website that provides the reasoning leading up to our final SCOPE project ideas, previous technologies in the same space, a list of resources and contacts in the industry, as well as interviews and feedback from co-designs with users.</p>

                    <p>For our final project in the course Introduction to Mechanical Prototyping, our team built a mechanical claw that was tested in dexterity, strength, and looks. In 6 weeks our four man team iterated through three complete versions of our claw design. The final iteration  had a plywood and 3D printed 3 claw structure with flexibility provided by a rubber polymer. The transmission relied on three cables crimped from each claw end to a steel lead screw powered by DC motor. For this iteration's transmission I CAD modeled and 3D printed both bevel gears used and turned down the lead screw to fit within the structure.</p>

                    <p>The prompt was to create a box with an "Olin" vibe. The goal was introduce students to fabrication methods and CAD modeling software. And the only requirements were to use a minimum of five different types of joints and five different fasteners. A partner and I had decided to recreate every Olin student's best friend: their laptop. The final assembly made of 1/8" baltic birch plywood includes a "screen" that can lock to the rest of the box using magnets, a detachable "battery" in the back, and a secret box that can be pushed out with dynamic mortise and tenon joints in the form of the "a" and "j" keys.</p>

                    <p>A fun final project for Real World Measurements was a set of three circuits that measured heart rate, galvanic skin response, and blood pressure. The three circuits were hooked up to volunteers who were then put into various scaring scenarios such as a climatic build up of terror and an unexpected jump scare. These responses were recorded and compared to a unscared control test prior to the testing.</p>

                    <p>After a semester of Modeling and Controls, a partner and I joined our new found circuit skills and our interest for DJ-ing into an original analog beat box. At the core of our project was a white noise generator that would create all the frequencies we were interested in using for our beat box. Two series of filters in parallel to get a bass and snare sound were then activated and deactivated by a square wave generated by operational amplifiers.</p>

                    <p>The culmination of a semester of Design Nature, our otter robot is a bio mimetic swimming toy designed specifically for fourth graders. The RC otter would be controlled by one player whose objective was to swim to the other side of a pool without having a magnitized fish stolen from its mouth. Two other players would control otters with strings to intercept the RC otter and take the fish. Fourth graders from a local elementary school were then brought in to play test and rate how fun the games were.</p>
