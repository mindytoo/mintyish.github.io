                <h3>The Project</h3>
                <p>In the spirit of self learning, Olin's Self Study course encourages students to pursue an interest by designing a course around it. One of my longest lasting and most time consuming hobbies have been playing video games. My interest has extended through the video gaming community into the content creation, fan art, and notably cosplay. Cosplayers celebrate a character from a different universe via dressing up and acting like that character. Having already done a smaller independent study on prop design and fabrication, I wanted to expand from building singular props for cosplays to creating the entire cosplay. My self study is focused on creating a cosplay of Blizzard's Tracer from the game Overwatch.

                <h3>The Design</h3>
                <p>Tracer is a female character who's notable notable for her glowing sci-fi armor and bright orange pants. She's a happy-go-lucky gunner with a British accent and wields dual pistols. The official reference art can be seen below.</p>
                <center>
                <img src="img\tracer\ref-1.jpg" width="80%">
                <img src="img\tracer\ref-2.jpg" width="80%">
                </center>
                <br>

                <p>The primary portions of the outfit can be broken down into the chest-plate, gauntlets, guns, jacket, and pants. Though the character is female, bringing Tracer to reality would have to include a few adjustments as the person cosplaying is male. However, these changes will largely remain in the cuts of the sewn sections of the outfit, the jacket and pants. It is good to note that there are slight differences that change between the official drawn art and the in game model as well as the official 3D model of Tracer.</p>

                <h3>The Chest Plate</h3>
                <p>Tracer's chest plate is the white, silver, and gray body armor with blue lights. A previous prop design for an Ezreal cosplay, shown below, worked with the same types of materials that would be used in creating the chest plate, namely craft foam, thermoplastic, and paint.</p>

                <center><img src="img\tracer\ez-1.jpg" width="40%"> <img src="img\tracer\ez-2.gif" width="40%"></center>
                <br>

                <p>I started out by modeling the housing for the lights in SolidWorks as I knew I would have more consistent detailing using the Makerbot 3D printers than I would have doing them by hand. The parts were printed in silver PLA.</p>

                <center>
                <img src="img\tracer\chestplate-1.jpg" width="40%"> <img src="img\tracer\chestplate-2.jpg" width="40%">
                </center>
                <br>

                <p>However, not all the parts printed well on the Makerbots. A common issue was misalignment or motor skipping which would result in the a XY shift of a layer or the extruder not close enough to the part to add new filament to existing layers. The latter occurred when printing this piece. Instead of printing a new piece. I opted to add a layer of worbla plastic to replace up the missing layers and close the part. </p>

                <center><img src="img\tracer\chestplate-4.jpg" width="60%"></center>
                <br>

                <p>For the lights, I had tried a new material, transparent ABS material, and printed plate-like parts to be housed by the silver PLA parts previously printed. Together, these parts would conceal a LED circuit while giving off an even bright glow. After going through the heating and cooling process, the transparent ABS became semi-translucent and great for diffusing light and giving a more even glow. The LED circuit had to be a few inches from the surface of the part however, to hide the view of individual LED lights.</p>

                <p>The lights themselves were made from off the shelf blue LEDs, stranded wire, solid core wire, protoboard, button, and a button battery in its holder. I tested the circuit first on a breadboard before mapping out a circular arrangement of the LEDs. The protoboard was smaller than the translucent plate and thin which made it much easier to hide within the chest-plate. The solid core wires, LEDs, and resistors were then soldered onto the protoboard and stranded wire was used to connect the two lights to a button and the battery.</p>

                <center><img src="img\tracer\led-4.jpg" width="40%"> <img src="img\tracer\led-3.jpg" width="40%"></center>
                <br>

                <p>The majority of other parts did not require as much detailing and could be built out of craft foam and made into a permanent shape via adding a layer of worbla thermoplastic. I started building outwards from the 3D printed parts using hot glue and foam to get the correct proportions and shapes. Once the sizes and shapes were correct, I layered worbla over them using a heat gun. </p>

                <center><img src="img\tracer\chestplate-3.jpg" width="27%"> <img src="img\tracer\chestplate-5.jpg" width="27%"> <img src="img\tracer\chestplate-6.jpg" width="27%"></center>
                <br>

                <p>Once all the parts were layered with worbla, I added a layer of resin to even out the surface of the worbla. In previous attempts, I had tried to smooth the surface of the worbla to prep for painting the parts using sand paper and wood glue. This method proved too time consuming (moving from grit to grit and then drying layers of wood glue). The resin is intended for smoothing 3D printing projects but worked very well for the worbla, creating a smooth surface for the paint. I then painted the parts using two types of spray paint, normal shiny and epoxy. The epoxy spray paint worked incredibly well and arguably would remove the need for the intermediate epoxy layer. The normal shiny spray paint had more issues however. The paint required more layers to look even and had difficulty sticking to the epoxy layer. A sanding step between the epoxy and the spray painting may have helped the spray paint stick better.</p>

                <br>
                
                <p>Assembling the painted parts had its own difficulties as I didn't spend much time thinking about interfacing between the parts and pinning them all together when they were only foam was extremely simple. I had to add a few supporting pieces of foam using hot glue and Loctite. The back portion of the chest-plate is seen below.</p>

                <center><img src="img\tracer\chestplate-10.jpg" width="80%"></center>
                <br>

                <h3>The Guns</h3>

                <p>I was able to find a CAD package of Tracer's pistols by <a href="https://www.myminifactory.com/object/tracer-gun-overwatch-19011">Simone Fantana</a> and printed the .stl files primarily on the Stratasys 3D printers. I opted to use the Stratasys after attempting to print the first handle on a Makerbot. Removing support material from the Makerbot print forced me to sacrifice the quality of the detailing and had lower resolution in general. Changing some of the tolerances on the .stl files, I attempted a print of the first gun on the Stratasys. The prints took longer and required post processing by placing the parts in a lye bath to remove the dissolvable support material. While the process took days compared to the hours of the Makerbot, I was much happier with the print quality and the fit of the pieces together.</p>

                <center><img src="img\tracer\gun-1.jpg" width="40%"> <img src="img\tracer\gun-2.jpg" width="40%"></center>
                <br>
                <center><img src="img\tracer\gun-5.gif" width="60%"></center>
                <br>

                <p>The resolution of the prints were high enough that the only intermediate step after printing and before painting was washing and draining the parts of lye. This took a few days as there was lye within many of the parts that would have to seep through the parts to fully exit. In some there was enough lye solution to hear swishing of liquids within the part. I then used the same two types of spray paint and applied a few coats to the parts. Additional blue detailing was done over the white spray paint using a mix of blue acrylic paint and glaze.</p>

                <br>

                <h3>The Pants and Jacket</h3>
                <p>Tracer wears a shearling bomber jacket with a leather exterior and bright orange-yellow gradient tights. I had adjusted the pant pattern to include a dart for the wearer and created a jacket pattern from a men's medium sized sweater. That being said, the biggest hurdle during this project, and one that I have still yet to overcome, is the sewing.</p>

                <p>I used muslin to test out the shapes of the patterns and decided to move forward with the pants by moving from muslin to a stretchy jersey fabric. While I had been trained in the Olin Library for use of the sewing machine, my practical experience was limited to sewing replacement buttons and patching socks by hand. The muslin was very sewing machine friendly but the Jersey fabric proved to be far more inconsistent when sewn. To help learn the sewing machine I had only been using the straight stitch setting which produced a wearable prototype but was far from ideal as the seams were not sealed well and the distance between stitches was inconsistent. Having felt like I knew enough about the sewing machine to try sewing the final fabric, Lycra with a custom printed pattern, I finished sewing a heather gray jersey fabric into the prototype tights.</p>

                <p>I then attempted to use the zig-zag stitch for the jersey fabric but that proved to be even more unreliable. However, when it did work, it worked very well, creating a tight but stretchable seams. I spent a few weeks trying out different permutations of thread tension, stitch distance, and sandwiching the fabric between paper layers. Upon the advice of a sewing NINJA, I dulled an all purpose sewing machine needle to create a rounder point but the threads remained as seen below.</p>

                <center><img src="img\tracer\pants-1.jpg" width="40%"> <img src="img\tracer\pants-2.jpg" width="40%"></center>
                <br>

                <h3>Remaining Work</h3>
                <p>The major remaining projects are the jacket and pants. As I will not have access to a sewing machine after this semester, I hope to be able to sew the parts by hand. Should that fail, I will outsource the sewing and focus on the final assembly. Measurements must be taken from the cosplayer to affix the chest-plate using elastic bands and Velcro. The gauntlets will be the next feature to build, but that will also rely on measurements taken from the cosplayer.</p>

                <p>I found the project to be a fun exploration behind the scenes of the cosplays I always fan over at events hosted by the video gaming community like PAX East. Attaching props to the human body in a manner that is both flexible and secure has been a great learning experience. I also had the chance to try the different fabrication methods suggested by professional cosplayers and will rely on their tutorials more in the future. I plan on continuing working on cosplays and building props as a hobby.</p>
