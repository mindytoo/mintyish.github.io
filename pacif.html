                <h3>The Context</h3>
                <p>One of the very first human behaviors learned is sucking. Sucking can be split into two catagories: nutritive, during which the infant acquires nourishment and non-nutritive, during which the infant does not ingest anything but experiences a calming effect. Although the pacifiers are hugely useful in comforting babies and infants, there has been studies conducted in recent decades that suggest negative long term effects of non-nutritive sucking. By understanding the perisaltic motions of the mouth and tongue during sucking, pediatric dentist, Dr. David Tesini and bio-medical engineer Mr. Josh Wiesman have developed a new pacifier design believed to reduce the impact of non-nutritive sucking on the upper palate. In order to prove the effectiveness of the design, they came to Dr. Chris Lee and his team of student researchers at Olin College for a simulation and analysis of the new dummy bulb designs. A more detailed write up of the entire project can be found on Chris Lee's <a href="http://faculty.olin.edu/~clee1/pacif.html">website</a>.</p>

                <h3>The Design</h3>
                <p>Dr. Tesini's first new design, the Tommee Tippee pacifier is similar to the Nature Orthodontic Pacifier, designed to collapse into a configuration that adheres to the contours of the upper palate. This prevents the tongue from wrapping around the sides of the pacifier bulb and compressing the bulb into a swallowable form. A common phenomenon that occurs with currently available commercial bulbs is that the bulb will be compressed by the tongue and form a median line of support along the upper palate. By creating a bulb that cannot be compressed laterally, Dr. Tesini and Mr. Wiesman's design supports the entire upper palate and reduces the likelyhood of upper palate collapse and deformation. The second design has a more convex bottom hemisphere as well as additional internal ribbings.</p>

                <p>Over 11 weeks from June to August 2015, CAD models for an infant's upper palate, Dr. Tesini's two new pacifier designs, the Soothie brand pacifier, and the NUK brand orthodontic pacifier were assembled into SolidWorks dynamic non-linear simulations. The CAD models for Tesini's designs, the upper palate, and the Soothie brand pacifier were provided by Mr. Wiesman while the NUK brand pacifier was created using a 3D scanner, smoothed in Blender, and hallowed out in SolidWorks.</p>

                <p>The four perisaltic motions that occur during sucking were abstracted into two pressures applied directly to the surfaces of the pacifier bulbs. The first two motions were simplified into one pressure against the bottom hemisphere of the pacifier bulbs. The second two motions were simplified into two inward pressures against the sides of the pacifier. These pressures were temporally offset but reached a peak intra-oral pressure of 58 mbar or .8688 psi. This value is based off A. Lindner's "Measurement of intra-oral negative air pressure during dummy sucking in human newborn".</p>

                <p>Further abstraction was applied to the material properties of the upper palate and the pacifier bulbs. The entire upper palate (teeth, gum, and other biological materials) was abstacted to one homogeneous, isotropic, linearly elastic material. The Poisson's Ratio and Young's Modulus for the upper palate and the silicone rubber for all four bulbs were taken from a paper by Levrini et. al, "Different geometric patterns of pacifiers compared on the basis of finite element analysis". The silicone rubber was defined as a non-linear material with a stress-curve that was taken from a sample cut from a NUK pacifier and loaded onto an Instron 3300.</p>

                <h3>The Results</h3>
                <p>Results comparing the bulb deformation and maximum palate stress of Tesini's two designs and the Soothie brand bulb were created from simulations of the first two perisaltic motions. Tesini's first design faired the best followed by his second and the Soothie brand pacifier faired the worst.</p>

                <p>Results comparing the bulb deformation and maximum palate stress of Tesini's first design and the Soothie brand bulb were created from simulations of all four (the two abstracted) perisaltic motions. Here, Tesini's design faired much better than the commercial brand.</p>

                <p>Working non-linear, dynamic simulations for the Soothie brand and Tommee Tippee pacifiers were finalized by the end of summer 2015. However, due to meshing errors in SolidWorks, working non-linear, dynamic simulations for the NUK pacifier and Tesini's second design were not reached. CAD models and simulation instructions for all four are available to the next research team but the findings for comparison across all four pacifier designs are not currently available and should be pursued in the future.</p>
